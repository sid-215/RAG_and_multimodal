Prior to making any investment or financial decisions, an investor should seek individualized advice\nfrom a personal financial, legal, tax and other financial professionals that take into account all of the particular facts and circumstances of an investor’s own situation. For corporate-bond and municipal-bond funds, the credit analysis depicts the\nquality of bonds in the fund's portfolio. The analysis reveals the percentage of fixed-income securities that fall within each credit-quality rating as assigned by Standard & Poor's or Moody's. At the top of the ratings are U.S. government bonds. Bonds\nissued and backed by the federal government are of extremely high quality and thus are considered superior to bonds rated AAA, which is the highest possible rating a corporate issue can receive. Morningstar gives U.S. government bonds a credit\nrating separate from AAA securities to allow for a more accurate credit analysis of a portfolio's holdings. Bonds with a B rating are the lowest bonds that are still considered to be of investment grade. Bonds that are rated lower than B (often called\njunk bonds or high-yield bonds) are considered to be quite speculative. Any bonds that appear in the NR/NA category are either not rated by Standard & Poor's or Moody's, or did not have a rating available at the time of publication.\nAs the model developer, J.P.

Illustrations of the historic performance of an asset allocation or illustrative portfolio do not reflect the results of actual trading of securities, but were calculated by\nthe retroactive application of historical performance of the investment returns to the illustrative portfolios.\nThe historical returns presented include all items of dividends and interest net of fees unless otherwise stated. Because the asset allocation and illustrative portfolios were structured with the benefit of knowing\nhow each asset class or specific security/ investment performed during the period shown, the hypothetical returns may be higher than the returns of an actual portfolio that would have been recommended\nduring that period. Model portfolio analysis within this report assumes that the asset allocation or portfolio was rebalanced monthly back to the initial asset allocation.

To understand the impact of individual investments and asset classes, J.P. Morgan calculates its contribution to risk and\nreturn. Intuitively, the assets with higher weight, higher volatility and a greater alignment with the portfolio return will contribute the most to the portfolio risk. Within this report, these measures are displayed at\nboth a major asset class and individual security level. To categorize each underlying investment’s major asset class, J.P. Morgan generally leverages asset class groups defined by Morningstar. (Equity,\nAlternatives, Fixed Income. Allocation = Multi-Asset and Other)\nReturn Decomposition:\nMeasures the contribution of an underlying investment on the model portfolio’s annualized total return. An investment’s return contribution is a linear calculation of monthly performance\nrelative to the portfolio. To calculate the return contribution of a asset class, J.P. Morgan uses the weighted average of the underlying investment returns.\nRisk Decomposition:\nThis measure considers the unique impact of each underlying investment’s volatility in the context of the model portfolio. To calculate, J.P. Morgan sums each underlying investment’s\nweighted standard deviation adjusted by its correlation to the model portfolio.\nDefinitions - Risk-reward statistics\nE\nStatistic definitions\nL\nR-squared: Reflects the percentage of a portfolio's movements that can be explained by movements in its benchmark. Measures of the correlation of the portfolio’s returns to the\nP\nbenchmark's returns. An R-squared of 100 indicates that all movements of a portfolio can be explained by movements in the benchmark. Conversely, a low R- squared indicates that very few\nof the portfolio's movements can be explained by movements in its benchmaMrk index R squared measure of 35, for example, means that only 35% of the portfolio’s movements can be\nexplained by movements in the benchmark index.\nA\nSharpe ratio: Measures a manager's excess return over the risk-free rate of return (normally the cash return), divided by the standard deviation. It is a statistical measure that incorporates\nreturn and risk into a single number. The ratiSo describes how much excess return you are receiving for the extra volatility that you endure for holding a riskier asset. The higher the Sharpe\nRatio, the better the portfolio’s historical risk-adjusted performance.\nStandard deviation: The standard deviation is a gauge of the variance of a manager's return over its average or mean. Statistically, it is the square root of the variance. Because it measures\ntotal variation of the return, standard deviation is a measure of total risk, unlike beta, which measures only market risk. Investors use the standard deviation to try to predict the range of\nreturns that is most likely for a given investment. When a portfolio has a high standard deviation, the predicted range of performance is wide, implying greater volatility. The converse, a low\nstandard deviation, implies that the portfolio will exhibit lower volatility.\nMarket capture ratios: Together the up and down-market capture ratios reveal a historical picture of a portfolio’s performance in those relative market environments. The ideal combination is\nan up- market capture > 100% and a down-market capture of < 100%.\nUp-market capture ratio: Measures a manager's performance in up markets relative to the index during the same period. A ratio value of 115 indicates that the manager has outperformed the\nmarket index by 15% in periods when the index has risen.\nDown-market capture ratio: This ratio is the direct opposite of the up-market capture ratio, gauging performance of the manager relative to the index in down markets. A ratio value of 80 would\nindicate the manager has declined only 80% as much as the declining overall market, indicating relative outperformance.\nExcess return: Returns in excess of the benchmark.\nFOR INSTITUTIONAL USE ONLY | NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION\n26"], [""]]}

The Fed, feeling behind\nthe curve, hikes aggressively throughout 2022 and reduces the size of its balance sheet. However, in the second half of 2022 consumer demand and economic growth moderate and inflationary pressures\nabate. This timing mismatch results in a policy error, which pushes the U.S. into recession. Despite monetary tightening, bond yields fall due to bearish growth expectations, and equities decline. The U.S. dollar\nfalls given the uncertain growth outlook, and global equities sell off as international economies face their own headwinds.\nFed soft-landing: Inflation gradually moderates as supply chain issues resolve, consumer demand wanes, and wage increases plateau. Profit growth is solid as input cost and wage pressures subside,\nsupporting margins. The Fed hikes gradually, allowing the economy to transition from “recovery” to “recovered” smoothly. Equities grind hEigher given decent earnings. Bond yields modestly decline given a\nmore subdued growth and inflation outlook. International economies experience similar easing inflation and monetary policy remains relatively dovish abroad.\nL\nStagflation: Inflation remains stubbornly high as labor shortages persist, wages rise, shelter costs increasPe, and supply chain issues are slow to resolve. Geopolitical conflict adds pressure to energy, food, and\nother commodity prices. Inflation outpaces wage increases and damages consumer sentiment. Consumer demand drops, weighing on growth but not precipitating a recession. However, unemployment\nM\nremains low, diverging from 1970s-style stagflation. High inflation prompts aggressive Fed rate hikes and balance sheet tightening, and bond yields rise. Equities fall due to sluggish growth, tighter monetary\npolicy, and slower earnings growth. Earnings growth falters due to slower revenue growth given less consumer demand, and margin pressures from higher input costs and wages. The specter of lasting higher\nA\nglobal inflation dampens returns abroad.\nS\nGlobal synchronous growth: As the U.S. economic recovery crests, the international recovery accelerates. Geopolitical tensions abate, diminishing growth headwinds. Pandemic policies loosen in Europe,\nJapan, and Asia, spurring a rebound in activity and supporting a more robust than expected earnings recovery and driving international equities higher. The emerging market recovery is somewhat uneven, but\nbegins to gain footing as well. Although China’s growth moderates, fewer reform surprises and an easing of its zero-COVID policy enable it to bounce back from a challenging 2021. International economic\ngrowth outperforms the U.S., resulting in a weaker dollar.\nInternational oil recession: Geopolitical conflict creates an energy crunch in Europe and widespread uncertainty in the emerging markets. Higher food, energy, and other commodity prices send inflation higher\nand consumption suffers in Europe, sparking a European recession and sinking DM equities. Although uncertainty challenges emerging markets, commodity exporters benefit from the price surges and\nChinese policy is easy, so the EM world as a whole avoids recession. Inflation concerns weigh on U.S. consumer sentiment and U.S. equities, but the economic impact is limited. Treasuries and global\ngovernment bonds experience safe haven flows, as does the U.S. dollar.\nRobust U.S. expansion: The U.S. economy continues to grow faster than its 2% trend pace, fueled by a healthy consumer, a pick-up in labor force participation, and greater business capex, which increases\nproductivity and supports margins. Earnings remain robust, supporting equities. Inflation remains strong but recedes from elevated levels, and given the solid growth and labor market backdrop, the Fed\ncontinues raising rates and reducing its balance sheet without much disruption to the economy. Brighter economic prospects and monetary tightening push bond yields higher. The U.S. outperforms\ninternational equities.\nFOR INSTITUTIONAL USE ONLY | NOT FOR PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION\n28"], [""]]}
